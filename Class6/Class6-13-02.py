'''
System.py is a module that is always built in a python script

For style, in class you always have to use the main program

The function that has the first indent, it goes for that one. This means that
it is not define because it is not being called

A function or method always takes a parenthesis

Functions should use one simple action so you can reuse it later on. The minute
liveCoding.
